# UFOs
## Overview
### Dana had us develop her a website based on UFO sitings. The website was generic with a filter search. However, she wanted the filter search to be more specfic with the point of entries a user could input. So, we altered the website and provide more input bars for users to be more specfic on there searches.
## Results
### When an individual views Dana's website, they will encounter a paragraph describing UFO sightings. Past the paragraph, the individual will see data entries dating between January 1st to January 13th 2010 (1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010). To the left of the data entries, an individual can input data relative to the table. For example, if a person inputs "nj", the table will update to all data entries that have state id as "nj"
