# UFOs
## Overview
### Dana had us develop her a website based on UFO sitings. The website was generic with a filter search. However, she wanted the filter search to be more specfic with the point of entries a user could input. So, we altered the website and provide more input bars for users to be more specfic on there searches.
## Results
### When an individual views Dana's website, they will encounter a paragraph describing UFO sightings. Past the paragraph, the individual will see data entries dating between January 1st to January 13th 2010 (1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010)(first image below). To the left of the data entries, an individual can input data relative to the table (second image below). For example, if a person inputs "nj" and presses enter on the keyboard, the table will update to all data entries that have state id as "nj" (third image below). This can work with any of the filters located on the filter search table.

## Summary
### The table is a great idea, but, it takes up a lot of space within the website. What we could do is just have one input box, and have all the filters within a drop down menu. That way, it will look neater and a whole lot more simplier. Another idea, we could keep the table all together, but, have the entries be intregrated into a drop down menu per filter.
